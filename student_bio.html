                <p> Born and raised in the northern suburbs of Atlanta, Ga, I taught high school physics and chemistry in Gainesville, Florida
                             for a year before moving to Colorado in 2018. During my time in Georgia I started playing lacrosse in middle school and
                             stuck with it all the way through college where I was a two-time all-american at Kennesaw State.With my lacrosse career
                             behind me I turned my attention to the snow to take a break from teaching before I started my career. Fortunately, I picked
                             up skiing quick and was hired on patrol after a season. I love the job and plan on doing it for forseeable future but unfortunately
                             my feet do not share my enthisiam for plastic boots. I am hoping that this course will open some new doors for me but also
                             there is an opportunity for me on patrol to help maintain and write the code that runs our dispatch program. Excited for the next 6 months.</p>
